Some basic C programs which I do to learn C

You probably don't want to use this as it is newbie code for now, but comments would be appreciated.

## What is in it?
### tsdate
A command that convert a timestamp to a human readable date string and the other way round.

Needs lots of massaging still. No real checks are done, which must still happen.

To use it, on a *nix filesystem:
`$ cd tsdate && make dt`
